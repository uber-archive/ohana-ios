Ohana is a framework for working with a user's contacts on the iOS platform. It provides a component-based architecture for loading and processing contacts, as well as managing state such as contact selection and tagging. Whether loading contacts to display to a user, or processing contact data programatically, Ohana provides a simple, but extensible, framework for contact access in your application.  Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/uber/ohana-ios/wiki) to learn how the library works.  There are two quickstart guides available: one for [Swift](https://github.com/uber/ohana-ios/wiki/Quick-Start-(Swift)) and one for [Objective-C](https://github.com/uber/ohana-ios/wiki/Quick-Start-(Objective-C)).  If you have any questions, feel free to ask on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ohana) (tag "ohana").
